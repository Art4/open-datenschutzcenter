oderProcessingInfoTitle: Oder processing info
orderProcessingInfoText: If your organisation processes data for an external person or organisation, this is referred to as "order processing". As a processor, you are not the responsible party, since the responsibility for data processing according to the GDPR lies with the customer. In order for the order processing to be contractually regulated, it is important to conclude an order processing contract with the client.
